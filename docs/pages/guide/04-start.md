After you have Yavin configured and running, we’ll begin detailing how to use the platform.  

Yavin landing Page
------------------------------------------
The default landing page of Yavin is the start of your data exploration. From there you can go to the directory listing (Listing all visualizations and visualization groups), or go to saved/shared reports (visualization) lists, the dashboards (group of visualization) list or start building your data analytics and reporting visualizations with the “Start Exploring” button.

Directory / “My Data”
----------------------------------------------
The Directory/“My Data” view carries all the active reports/Dashboards that you have previously created as well as any reports and dashboards that have been shared with you. Within the “My Data” page you can:
-   Create new Reports and/or Dashboards
-   Filter based on your “Favorites” Reports/Dashboards
-   Search for specific Reports/Dashboards
-   Filter by Reports/Dashboards
-   Perform actions on a report (Clone, Export, Share,Schedule, Delete)
-   Perform actions on a dashboard (Clone, Export, Share,Delete)

Reports
-------------------------------
A report is a user defined query coupled with a visual representation (table, graph, etc) of the returned query result. With a report, you can freely explore the various dimensions and measures of your data. Shown below is a line chart visualization from a report showing the “Netflix TV shows release dates”, filtering only for TV shows, and release date = 2014. With “Release Date” as dimension and “Total Seasons” and “Count”  as metrics.

High level operations on a report :

From within the report you have multiple options. Each option is shown with its associated screen icon. You can do any of the following:
You can rename, add to favorite, add to dashboard, copy API query, clone, export, share and delete


|      Operation                      |  Availability                       |

| <img src="assets/images/GS_delete.png" width="100"/>     |  Now    |
{:.table}

All operations are assosiated with a tooltips guide:

At any time in a report, you can perform one of the following operations : Run,  Save, Save As, Revert
<img src="assets/images/GS_report_action.png" width="400"/>

### Exploring Reports
Reports are designed to be explored intuitively, easily and quickly.
1.  Create a new report from Yavin’s directory view
<img src="assets/images/GS_my_data_newreport.png" />
1.  Select a table
<img src="assets/images/GS_table_selector.png" />
1.  Select a dimension
<img src="assets/images/GS_dimension_selector.png" />
1.  Select a metrics
<img src="assets/images/GS_metric_selector.png" />
1.  Update your filters
<img src="assets/images/GS_report_filter_sample.png" width="800"/>
1.  Select run report button
<img src="assets/images/GS_run_saveReport.png" />

Here is a brief, animated demo of exploring and running a Yavin report :

Dashboards
----------------------------------
Yavin lets you take multiple reports and organize them into a dashboard even if the reports have different visualizations. Dashboards allow you to position and size the individual reports as you desire. They are useful when your user may need to compare various reports or when their decision making requires taking multiple views of the data into account.

From within a Dashboard, you can do all of the following. The on-screen icon is shown beside the command:

|      Operation                      |  Availability                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Rename   <img src="assets/images/GS_edit.png" width="50"/>  | Now         |
| Add too Favorite     <img src="assets/images/GS_star.png" width="50"/>       |     Now          |
| <img src="assets/images/GS_clone_with_text.png" width="100"/> | Now         |
| <img src="assets/images/GS_share_withText.png" width="100"/>     |  Now    |
| <img src="assets/images/GS_delete.png" width="100"/>     |  Now    |
| <img src="assets/images/GS_add_widget.png" width="150"/>    |  Now    |
| <img src="assets/images/GS_settings_add_filter.png" width="100"/>     |  Now    |
{:.table}

At any time in a dashboard, you can perform one of the following operations : Save Changer, Revert Changes

### Exploring and Managing Dashboards:
Dashboards are designed to be explored intuitively, easily and quickly.

<figure style="font-size:0.6vw; color:DodgerBlue;"><img style="border:2px solid black;" src="assets/images/GS_managing_dashboard.gif" width="800"/><figcaption>Gif animation - Exploring dashboards “in action” </figcaption> </figure>

Dashboards are built by adding reports to them one at a time. There are two ways of adding a report to a dashboard.
- Through the Dashboard view.
- Through the report view.

#### Adding Reports to a Dashboard from the Dashboard view
From the dashboard itself, use the “+ Add Widget” feature as illustrated: <img src="assets/images/GS_add_widget.png" width="150"/>

1.  Select <img src="assets/images/GS_add_widget.png" width ="150"/> to add an already existing report to the Dashboard
1.  Select the report, like this: <img src="assets/images/GS_add_widget_dialog.png" width="500"/>
1.  You can choose between creating a new report, or using an existing one : <img src="assets/images/GS_add_widget2.png" width="300"/>
<img src="assets/images/GS_add_search_widget.png" width="300"/>
1.  The Report will be added to the dashboard as a widget: <img src="assets/images/GS_table_row.png" width="700"/>
1.  The Report / Widget can be resized, edited and deleted: <img src="assets/images/GS_table_sample.png" width="700"/>

#### Adding Reports to a Dashboard from the Report view
1. A report can be added to the dashboard by selecting a previously saved report through the “Add to Dashboard” option as illustrated: <img  src="assets/images/GS_dashboard_tool_tip.png" width="300"/>
1. You can choose to create a new Dashboard, or to add the report to an existing dashboard: <img src="assets/images/GS_add_to_dashboard.png" width="300"/>   <img src="assets/images/GS_add_to_dashboard_select_widget.png" width="300"/>

#### Modifying / Editing Dashboards:
The reports/widgets in a dashboard can be organized, resized, explored, filtered and edited to align with how we want the Dashboard to look as. Reports in a Dashboard can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon (<img src="assets/images/GS_edit.png" width="50"/>) in the header of the widget/report. This will activate the edit mode for that report. Reports in a dashboard can also be resized, re-arranged and deleted.

Dimensions
----------------------------------
Dimensions are the primary concept when exploring your data. Dimensions are attributes and characteristics of your data. For example: In the domain of web analytics, dimensions might include properties of your website users - gender, age, location, etc. Dimension represents some quality that can distinguish one part of your data from another. Dimensions can be used to slice your data into slices, and to focus on a specific slice using filters. In Yavin, Dimensions live in the dimension panel in the report. They can be searched by, filtered by and added to the report for insights and reporting.

Metrics
-------------------------------
Metrics provide a numeric value to associate to dimensions. Yavin has the ability to support these kinds of Metrics and many others {a number, a Count (a total or a sum), an average, a Ratio (one number divided by another number)}. Metrics are measurable. Metrics are math formulas applied over the zero or more dimensions that are selected to break down your data for a particular query, view, or report. They can give you an overview of the components of your data , and help distinguish important components from less important ones. In Yavin, Metrics live in the Metrics Panel in the report. They can be searched for, filtered by, and added to the report.

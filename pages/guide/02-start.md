## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Yavin, make sure your system has **Java 8 or greater**. You can find free prebuilt OpenJDK binaries at **[https://adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net)**.

## Boot Example Yavin App Locally

Once your machine has all met the prerequisites, run the following steps to boot the example Yavin app:

### 1. Clone the project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yahoo/yavin.git
```

### 2.1 (Option 1): Run Jar Locally

```shell
cd yavin/packages/webservice                 
./gradlew bootRun                           
```
### 2.2 (Option 2): Launch Demo App in Docker Container

If local port is different then change the argument in below command. Format is ```-p <host port>:<container port>```

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/verizonmedia/yavin_demo:latest
```

(To stop the server at any time, type Ctrl-C in your terminal.)

### 3. Open The App In Your Browser

Congratulations! You can now open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**. This will launch the **Yavin** application into your browser with the built in data set for [Netflix and TV shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) that is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) data.
